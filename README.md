<h1>Capstone 3: Letterboxd Movie Recommendation System</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Letterboxd is a social media platform that provides film enthusiasts with a space to review films, create lists of movies, and find other fans to connect with. Other features include keeping track of one’s personal history of movies seen, a watchlist of movies that one wants to see in the future that can be constantly updated, and the chance to see what friends, critics and fellow fans are watching and reviewing. However, the platform currently does not have an official recommendation system that analyzes a user’s movie history and watchlist to provide recommendations of movies to watch and review. 
<br><br>
The goal of this third capstone project is to create a recommendation system based on data from Letterboxd and TMDB (The Movie Database). </p>

<h2>Datasets</h2>

<p>Notably, the Letterboxd API is, as of the date of this project proposal, in private beta. In lieu of this, the first dataset linked in the above list contains scraped, publicly-accessible Letterboxd ratings data of the top 4000 users on the platform in any given month.</p>

<h2>Data Approach</h2>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>The target audience for this project is Letterboxd users. </p>

<h3>Envisioned Approach</h3>
<p>Creating a recommendation system based on collaborative filtering (using a matrix factorization-based model or KNN) that provides users with movie recommendations based on their movie history and past reviews/ratings. Steps in the process include:<br>
Data Wrangling/Cleaning<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing<br>
Feature Engineering and Data Modeling<br>
Creation of a platform for the project<br>
Data Visualization and Presentation</p>
